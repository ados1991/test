In the XXXXX space, we provide two dataviews:

vaulthprod

vaultprod

These two dataviews allow you to search and analyze the logs of your activities on the Vault cluster, respectively for the qualification and production environments.

The following dashboards are linked to these dataviews:

[QUAL] Dashboard associated with the dataview vaulthprod

[PROD] Dashboard associated with the dataview vaultprod

Both dashboards include a common set of panels designed to help you analyze your logs, gain insights, and improve your Quality of Service (QoS).

By default, the Business Owners, Technical IT, and the Support Group have access to the logs related to your apcode and its associated ecosystems.

They hold Manager roles and can grant View permissions to users who do not yet have access to the apcode logs.

.

The same process applies to ecosystems: you must identify the apcode owner of the ecosystem. You can find the apcode owner of your ecosystem in the reference directory available here
, for example.
